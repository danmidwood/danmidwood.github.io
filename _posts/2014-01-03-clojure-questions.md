Clojure Questions is a Twitter bot that reads new questions from Stackoverflow and posts them to Twitter.

Originally developed by [Anthony Grimes](https://github.com/Raynes), I took over the project in January '14 after it fell into neglect, fixing it up and deploying it to Heroku where it could live on.
